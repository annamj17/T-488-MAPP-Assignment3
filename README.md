## General Info
In this assignment we created an application which displays movies that are currently
playing in cinemas in Iceland. We used an external API to get information related to cinemas and
their movies.

## External API
We will be using an API provided by kvikmyndir.is which is documented here: http://
api.kvikmyndir.is/. In order to use the API you must register by pressing the ‘Register’ button
